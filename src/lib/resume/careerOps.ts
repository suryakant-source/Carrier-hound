4. Natural incorporation of target domain and tech keywords: ${missingKeywords.slice(0, 8).join(", ") || "Role-specific technologies"}.
5. STRICT ZERO-HALLUCINATIONS:
   - Do NOT invent companies, employers, degrees, graduation years, or unverified claims.
   - Only re-frame, prioritize, and articulate the candidate's genuine achievements using the target JD's vocabulary.

Follow the Career-Ops 4-Stage Structure:
Stage 1 (The Hook): Acknowledge ${job.company}'s work and articulate why ${candidate.name} is specifically applying for ${job.title}.
Stage 2 (Their Challenges): Reference the technical and operational challenges described in the job listing.
Stage 3 (My Approach & Proof Points): Present concrete accomplishments from candidate's real experience that prove readiness to tackle those exact challenges.
Stage 4 (The Close): Reiterate enthusiasm and propose a conversation about contributing to ${job.company}'s roadmap.

Rule: ZERO hallucinations. Only cite verified candidate projects and technologies.
